    "In this module we have a very simple script that allows you to clip a large video into a bunch of smaller videos based on annotations. For example, you might have some gestures or trials annotated in a video, and since you only care about those moments you may want to automatically render smaller videos that only contains those events, which can then be further submitted for motion tracking or analysis (e.g., gesture networks). \n",
